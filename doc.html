    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>My goal for this site is to have a portfolio that I designed myself that can be used as work to show my Web Dev
        experience to potential employers.</p>
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
        In order to make things look good in the final build and include everything I wanted, I needed to make some
        changes to the initial design I planned. Instead of the long column to the left, I shifted that section to the
        second to last section of the main grid so that I could show my resume and have it be at a width to be fully
        visible. I also made the project section so that pictures and text were always on the same side instead of
        alternating. I felt this would look cleaner than the initial magazine layout since I no longer would have that
        side column.
        <br>
        For the mobile layout, beside order of sections, the only real change I made was stacking all the projects on
        top of each other like the regular layout instead of having them next to each other.

    <h2>Initial Proposal</h2>
    <p>I plan on creating an Anime Recommendation Web Service Application. <br>
        Purpose: To help people find new anime to watch that are similar to ones they've already watched <br>
        Audience: People that watch anime and are trying to find more similar ones to watch <br>
        Main Functionality: The Web App will utilize the MyAnimeList Recommendations section associated with each anime
        to recommend anime to watch that are similar to the one they search for.<br>
        I plan on using the Jikan Unofficial MyAnimeList API.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>I ultimately had to change my proposal a bit. Due to the number of requests to the API that had to be made in
        order to retrieve the necessary information I wanted, I could not continue with my original idea of each result
        showing a synopsis of the anime and its score on my anime list. I ended up changing my results to display the
        number of people that recommended the show and a link to the recommendations so that the user can go to
        MyAnimeList and read for themselves why people recommend the anime.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>
    <h3>12/20/2022</h3>
    <p>I've updated the Web App to work with v4 of the Jikan API, as v3 was discontinued earlier this year.
        Unfortunately the
        primary reason I chose v3 at the time was because the search function worked like the MyAnimeList website where
        a user could enter alternate titles or have mispellings and still receive the same results as if they entered
        the original title exactly. For now the user has to enter the exact original title, but I will update the app
        when the search function improves.</p>

    <h3>4/2/2024</h3>
    <p>As of this update, v4 of the Jikan API has updated its search function to allow mispellings and alternate titles
        to still return recommendations for the same anime. Now the user no longer needs to enter the exact title of the
        anime they are looking for recommendations from.</p>

    <h2>Color Palette</h2>

    <h2>Grade</h2>
    <p>If I were to give myself a grade based solely on the final product I would probably give myself at least a B+, as
        despite not being able to create the product I initially wanted, I was still able to create something close to
        it that is completely functional, pleasing to look at, and has no HTML, JS, or CSS errors.</p>

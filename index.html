                <p>
                    Hi there! My name is Omar and I'm from Atlanta, GA. I'm a 4th Year Game Design and Development major
                    at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I believe games can be used not only as a medium for
                    entertainment, but also as a way to provide people with experiences they could never have otherwise.
                    That's what I strive to achieve in my games so I can open people up to parts of the world and
                    experiences they never would have dreamed of reaching. When I'm not designing video games, you can
                    find me playing them, watching YouTube, dancing, or spending time with friends.

                    far as they can through an endless haunted mansion while attacking ghosts and avoiding furniture
                    as the game progressively speeds up.

                    Built a web application using the Jikan API to give a user a list of recommended anime series based
                    on the user-inputted series. Web app includes functionality to sort results alphabetically, (A-Z &
                    Z-A) or by the number of users who recommend a series.

                    Built a web application using the RESTful Pok√©mon API to create a Wordle-like experience, where the
                    user has to guess a mystery pokemon within a certain amount of tries, receiving comparative info
                    based on the pokemon they guess.

                    Built a web game where the player controls a spaceship and must defend the earth against ever
                    increasing waves of asteroids. There is also a shop between each wave where the player can increase
                    stats using points earned in each wave.
